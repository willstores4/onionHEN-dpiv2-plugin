DPI v2 receives PS4 and PS5 `.pkg` files over the local network, stages them
on the console, and submits them to the PS5 system installer. It is a normal
OnionHEN plugin ELF with an embedded descriptor and WebUI; no separate package
or runtime assets are required.

The browser remains the primary installer interface. The dynamic OnionHEN XML
page is deliberately limited to service configuration: start/stop, API port,
WebUI port, and restart.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop multi-file uploads from a desktop or mobile browser
- Chunked transfer, resumable staging, and staged-file reuse
- PS4/PS5 package detection before installation
- Sortable install queue, per-file retry, and live SSE progress
- Localized WebUI and console notifications for 14 languages
- Configurable API and WebUI ports with rollback if rebinding fails
- Graceful start, stop, reload, replacement, and removal through OnionHEN

## Requirements

- An OnionHEN build with external plugin support
- [OnionHEN Plugin SDK](https://github.com/OnionBuddies/onionHEN-plugin-sdk)
- [PS5 Payload SDK](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk)
- CMake 3.20 or newer, Ninja, Git, and Python 3.9 or newer
- Node.js and npm only when rebuilding the WebUI

## Build

```sh
export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/path/to/ps5-payload-sdk
cmake --preset ps5
cmake --build --preset ps5
```

The result is `build-ps5/bin/dpiv2.elf`. The build validates the embedded
descriptor automatically.

The SDK dependency is pinned to a tested commit. During SDK development, use a
local checkout:

```sh
cmake --preset ps5 \
  -DONIONHEN_PLUGIN_SDK_SOURCE=/path/to/onionHEN-plugin-sdk
cmake --build --preset ps5
```

To rebuild the embedded browser application:

```sh
cd webui
npm ci
npm run build
```

`webui/dist/index.html` is a single-file production bundle and is embedded in
the ELF at build time.

## Install

Upload the ELF atomically as
`/data/OnionHEN/plugins/DPIV00001.installing`, then rename it to
`/data/OnionHEN/plugins/DPIV00001.elf` after the upload completes.

OnionHEN discovers and starts it automatically. Open **★ OnionHEN Plugins →
DPI v2** to enable or disable the server, change its ports, or restart it.

With the default configuration, open this URL from another device on the same
network:

```text
http://<PS5-IP>:12800
```

TCP `9090` serves the DPI transfer API and TCP `12800` serves the WebUI and SSE
stream. The ports must be different. Changes are stored in
`/data/OnionHEN/plugins/DPIV00001.ini`.

## Storage and logs

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/data/OnionHEN/pkgs/` | Staged package uploads retained for retry/reuse |
| `/data/OnionHEN/plugins/DPIV00001.ini` | Enabled state and listener ports |
| `/data/OnionHEN/DPIV00001.log` | Plugin lifecycle and dynamic UI errors |
| `/data/OnionHEN/DPIV00001-server.log` | DPI transfer and installer log |

See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) for the HTTP and SSE protocol.

## Security

DPI listens on all console network interfaces and does not authenticate
clients. Use it only on a trusted local network, stop it when it is not needed,
and never expose either port to the internet. Uploaded packages are untrusted
input; final package validation is performed by the PS5 system installer.
